Code to refactor
=================


i tried to refactor the code in controller and in repository using different techniques.
first of all i use route mode binding because it will automatically map id with our model and provide resource.
secondly i use auth() helper function for authenticated user.
i used return statement early in code flow to avoid multiple if statement
use associative array to avoid for loops and used key value pair and avoid numerical indexing
break down code in multiple and reusable functions.
remove unused code  and variable.
try to make short, readable and reusable code

booking repository code was very long but i try to make refactor the most of the code.



Thank you!
